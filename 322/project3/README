Project 3: Memory allocation library

Known problems: ls still causes segfaults. I've run out of time to debug,
and cat and simple test programs still work.

Design: It doesn't seem like there's anything 'special' per se about the
implementation.

Notes: This was an amazing learning opportunity. I probably learned more
under-the-hood functionality with this program than anything I've done
before.
