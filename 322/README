Project 1: Leak counter and System Call tracer

Known problems: sctracer doesn't work. I don't know why, and I've run out
of time/patience with debugging it. It gets caught in a loop while tokenizing
the program/argument string, and I'm sure it has something to do with a lack
of understanding of C pointers/string handling/etc.

Design: I originally wanted to pipe communication between the parent and child
process, but discovered it was much easier to dump a list of leaks via the
library destructor. Beyond that, the design wasn't complicated or difficult
for leakcount. Most of my time was spend learning how to make the appropriate
calls and relearning variable scopes.

Also, I wanted to use the macros in /sys/queue.h, but found that my own linked
list implementation was more reliable (I'm probably doing it wrong).
