Project 2: Thread Library of DOOOOM.

Known problems: 

*Timing: a short enough interrupt interval (< 15 us) will cause segfaults. Or
		bus errors. I was unable to trace the root of these, as it was
		inconsistent in GDB -- it varied depending on the interval length,
		and so was hard to pinpoint.

*Mutex:	As of this writing, they're not working. Scratch that... they're not
		even implemented. I will try to get them up and running, but 2 hours doesn't bode well.


Design: 

I can't say this was a clever design, but it works and taught me even
		more about pointers and memory management in C. If I were to do locks
		and convars I'd be using a similarly mundane design; arrays of ints to
		track locks. I'm sure it's not that bad, I just ran out of time.
