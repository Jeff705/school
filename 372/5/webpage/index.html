            <p style="background-color: #009124;"> This application was
              developed for people who love to cook, but hate deciding on what
              to eat! By allowing the user to select a list of ingredients they
              already have in their house, the program helps the user ensure
              that no ingredients are wasted, and perhaps introduces them to
              recipes they've never tried before!</p>

            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p> This project is implemented in Python, using the Tkinter GUI
              framework. The interface is simple and as intuitive as possible,
              with the ingredient selection menu mimicking what might be found
              in a Windows dialog.</p>
            <p> The program exploits the Model-View-Controller design
              architecture to compartmentalize functionality and allow more
              rigorous testing. Loading and saving retentive data uses a
              Singleton called DataRepo. The recipe and ingredient information
              is stored in XML format; cElementTree is used to save and load
              these files.</p>
