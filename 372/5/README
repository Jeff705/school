Proj No: 4, First Project Deliverable

Description:
This submission includes the functional core for my final project.
This function core consists of a model (rrModel.py) and a Singleton class for
storage (DataRepo.py). This isn't as far as I'd intended to get, but I wrestled
with how to store data for longer than I should have.

All methods that are implemented (i.e. don't have "pass" in the definition body)
are functional and testable. Demo upon request.

The Second project deliverable will include: A full MVC plus the DataRepo with
  full functionality implemented (all getters, setters, etc). I hope to have at
  least enough recipes built to showcase a proof-of-concept, as well as a rough
  method of entry for new recipes.

The Final project deliverable will include: the full implementation of Recipe
  Roundup, with at least 10 recipes, bug-free lookup capability, and a smooth
  method of recipe entry.


Extras that I would like to do if I the have time and intestinal
fortitude: automated recipe parsing. It's a long shot at best, and a pipe dream
at worst.
