Project no: 2
Project due date: 7/4/14
Project description: Intro to Scripting

The Specs that I implemented are: Traverse class encapsulation, odd
	file name handling, appears to ignore .svn and .git directories
	(the last was not rigorously tested).

The Specs that I was unable to implement are: N/A

Extras: As you said, I was overthinking this assignment. Thanks for the clarity.
