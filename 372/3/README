Project description: Building a GUI

The Specs that I implemented are: Put a GUI on the existing Traverse code
	and convert to a MVC framework.

The Specs that I was unable to implement are: Keeping all the data in the model!	I was unsure of how to get my entry text in the model, so it lives in
	the view, much to my chagrin.

Extras: No extras this time, unless you count the scroll bar. I thought it was
	pretty neat that I put the text in the search box that disappears the
	moment you click to enter your own.
