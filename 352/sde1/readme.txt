SDE #1: flex and bison for fun and profit... or headaches.

Included files:

schedule.in: flex input file, includes rules for dumping whitespace, recognizing tokens, and failing upon syntax errors.

schedule.y: bison input file, used to build a parse tree for the scheduling data structures

schedule.c: essentially just #includes for dependencies and main, nothing special here.

schedule.log: a log file of 30 test cases, half good and half bad.

Pledge:
On my honor I have neither given nor received aid on this exam.
