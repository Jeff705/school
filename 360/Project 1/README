 Password breaker (client and server).

 Compilation: 	make (no special treatment needed).
 				can build individually using make password<Breaker/Server> if desired.

 Execution:		server: ./passwordServer <port> <password size> [<initial password>]
 						password size may be 1-8 characters, alphanumeric only.
 						initial password is optional.

 				client: ./passwordBreaker <server IP> <server port> <password size>

 Description:

 		passwordServer: will generate an n-character alphanumeric string as a password,
 		where 'n' is defined by the user. Server then listens indefinitely until it
 		receives the correct password, upon which it will print a status message and
 		generate a new random string. Will run until killed by CTRL+C or kill.

 		passwordClient: sequentially generates n-character alphanumeric passwords and
 		sends them to a defined IP/port combination. Terminates upon receiving confirmation
 		from the server, 5 1-second timeouts, or being killed by the user.
